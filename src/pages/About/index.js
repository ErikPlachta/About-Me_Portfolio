              an ability to think systematically and solve problems objectively.

                I enjoy building systems and workflows that are scalable,
                modular, and efficient. It's something I've learned to do in all
                of my work.

              <b>Outside of work</b>, I spend a lot of time with family. As far as 
              hobbies go, I enjoy being challenged so I'd say my hobby is learning.
              Technology, Software development, personal knowledge management, and
              stoicism are my go-tos over the past few years.
