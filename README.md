### About Me

---

**I'm a software developer, IT Director, project manager, and productivity nerd.**

I enjoy identifying patterns to build modular infrastructure and designs. Once you understand the problem, it's easy to build thoughtful, light-weight, and modular framework.

---

ü•á **Python, PowerShell, and SQL are the primary languages I use profesionally**

- I've beena professional IT Engineer for over 10 years. Along with providing IT services, I build custom software solutions to automate what I can. Developing with Python and PowerShell is a part of my every-day job.
- In 2017, I also started working directly with a SQL Engineer to provide SQL support and services to remote clients. We primarily use Python, SQL, and PoweShel.

---

ü•à **Secondary is JavaScript, CSS, and HTML**

- For the past 2 years, I've been learning these languages to bridge the gap from backend and front.
- Currently taking classes at [UNC Charlotte](https://www.charlotte.edu) to expand my knowledge and build a solid foundation.
