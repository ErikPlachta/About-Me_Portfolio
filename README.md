## :wave: Hello, and welcome to my GitHub landing page

My name is Erik, and I'm a Software Developer and IT Engineer by hobby and profession.

I use this Repo as a personal portfolio.
If you want to learn more about me and my work, [I've published the content in this Repo to a GitHub Site](https://erikplachta.github.io/ErikPlachta/)

I use GitHub to manage my apps, and host custom domains.
The majority of my repos are public, because building in public improves the quality of my work.
> I find myself more challenged and focused on releasing MVP.
